The TMDb Movies Dataset contains information about movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). It includes details such as budget, revenue, cast, director, popularity, and more, making it useful for analyzing trends in the film industry.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 10,866 movies with 21 attributes. Below are the key columns:

3. The dataset size was reduced from 1.7+ MB to 1.3+ MB after preprocessing.
