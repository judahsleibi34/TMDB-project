# TMDB Movie Dataset Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes the TMDb Movies Dataset, which contains detailed information about movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). The dataset includes attributes such as budget, revenue, cast, director, popularity, and more, making it a valuable resource for exploring trends and patterns in the film industry.

The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights into the relationship between movie attributes (e.g., budget, runtime, genre) and financial success (revenue). Additionally, the project focuses on data cleaning, handling missing values, and visualizing key trends to provide actionable insights.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 10,866 movies with 21 attributes. Below are the key columns:

### Column Name	Description
id	Unique identifier for the movie.
imdb_id	IMDb identifier for the movie.
popularity	Popularity score of the movie.
budget	Production budget (in USD).
revenue	Total revenue generated by the movie (in USD).
original_title	Original title of the movie.
cast	List of main actors in the movie.
homepage	Official website of the movie (if available).
director	Director of the movie.
tagline	Promotional tagline for the movie.
keywords	Keywords associated with the movie.
overview	Short summary of the movie.
runtime	Duration of the movie (in minutes).
genres	Genres associated with the movie (e.g., Action, Comedy).
production_companies	Production companies involved in the movie.
release_date	Release date of the movie.
vote_count	Number of votes received by the movie.
vote_average	Average rating of the movie.
release_year	Year of release.
budget_adj	Budget adjusted for inflation (in USD).
revenue_adj	Revenue adjusted for inflation (in USD).
## Key Insights
1. High Budget ≠ High Financial Return

The analysis reveals that a high production budget does not guarantee high financial returns. Many high-budget movies underperform, while some low-budget movies achieve significant success.

2. Weak Positive Correlation Between Runtime and Revenue

There is a weak positive correlation between movie runtime and financial success. Longer movies tend to generate slightly higher revenue, but this is not a strong indicator.

3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Null values and outliers were identified and removed to ensure data quality.

The dataset size was reduced from 1.7+ MB to 1.2+ MB after cleaning.

The shape of the dataset changed from (10866, 21) to (9882, 21).

4. Duplication Handling

Duplicate entries were examined but not removed entirely, as some overlaps were due to similarities in naming conventions.

5. Visualizations

Histograms were used to understand the distribution of data and detect outliers early in the analysis.

Heatmaps were employed to visualize correlations between variables, such as budget, revenue, and popularity.

## Tools and Techniques
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Cleaning: Handling null values, removing outliers, and deduplication.

Visualization: Histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots, and bar charts.

Statistical Analysis: Correlation analysis and descriptive statistics.
